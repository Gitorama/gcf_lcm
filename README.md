# gcf_lcm

The purpose of this project is to find the Greatest Common Factor and the Least Common Multiple of two numbers selected by the user

This is a program that could be incorporated into any Math software in which the student can be tasked with finding the GCF or the LCM
of two numbers. 

Created the program using Python. I created two different functions. One that will compute the GCF of two numbers and the other that 
will compute the LCM.
